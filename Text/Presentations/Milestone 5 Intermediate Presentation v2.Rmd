# The Diamonds dataset

- This large dataset has 53940 rows (diamonds) of ten variables (approx 540,000 values) 
- Slow to process!
- Nine of the variables are various measures of diamond size and quality, while the tenth is the price 
- We selected diamonds because it was simple to understand what each variable was measuring, and to have the opportunity to work with a large dataset 
- Particularly interested in which variables are most predictive of diamond price

# The Variables
 \textcolor{red}{red font = categorical variable}
 
-   carat: the diamond's weight
-   \textcolor{red}{cut: a measure of quality}
-   \textcolor{red}{color: a measure of colour quality}
-   \textcolor{red}{clarity: a measure of clearness}
-   x: length in mm
-   y: width in mm 
-   z: depth in mm
-   depth: total depth percentage
-   table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point
-   price: the price of the diamond in US dollars

# The Response Variable

'Price' seemed to us to be the obvious response variable. 

# Data Visualization (the dataset)

\footnotesize
```{r, echo = FALSE}
diamonds <- read.csv("./diamonds.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")
diamonds$X <- NULL
diamonds[1:5,]
```
\normalsize


# Data Visualisation (pairs plot)

# Other things of interest

The EDA revealed the following:

- some variables not Normally distributed
- long right tails due to a few very expensive diamonds
- some zero values

# Next Steps

- Principal Component Analysis
- Regression using the Principal Components
- Find best predictor variable for price
