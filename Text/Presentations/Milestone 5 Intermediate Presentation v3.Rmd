# The Diamonds dataset

- This large dataset has 53940 rows (diamonds) of ten variables (approx 540,000 values)\linebreak 
- Slow to process!\linebreak
- Nine of the variables are various measures of diamond size and quality, while the tenth is the price\linebreak
- We selected diamonds because it was simple to understand what each variable was measuring, and to have the opportunity to work with a large dataset\linebreak
- Particularly interested in which variables are most predictive of diamond price

# The Variables
 \textcolor{red}{red font = categorical variable}
 
-   carat: the diamond's weight
-   \textcolor{red}{cut: a measure of quality}
-   \textcolor{red}{color: a measure of colour quality}
-   \textcolor{red}{clarity: a measure of clearness}
-   x: length in mm
-   y: width in mm 
-   z: depth in mm
-   depth: total depth percentage
-   table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point
-   price: the price of the diamond in US dollars

# Other things of interest

The EDA revealed the following:

- some variables not Normally distributed\linebreak
- long right tail for 'price' due to a few very expensive diamonds\linebreak
- some zero values\linebreak
- 'price' probably follows a beta distribution (from the Cullen-Frey plot)

# Next Steps

- Principal Component Analysis\linebreak
- Regression using the Principal Components\linebreak
- Find best predictor variable for price
