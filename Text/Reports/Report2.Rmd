# Second Project Report

## Introduction

We report on the dataset we have selected for our Group Project. It contains 53940 items of data on diamonds. There are three categorical variables: cut, clarity and color, and seven numerical variables: carat, depth, table, price, and measurements of the diamonds x, y, z. 

## Platform and Data

The data comes from base R datasets, under package "datasets".

Categorical data:

* cut: levels of diamonds proportion, symmetry and polish
* clarity: levels of clarity
* color: color of the diamonds

Numeric data:

*  carat = weight in carat
*  depth = the distance between the culet and the table in millimeters
*  table = width of the table facet devided by the width of the diamond in percentage
*  price = price of the diamonds
*  x = length in mm
*  y = width in mm
*  z = depth in mm
